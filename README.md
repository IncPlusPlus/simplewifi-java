# simplewifi-java

SimpleWifi-Java is a library that exposes some of the API of [SimpleWifi](https://github.com/TheObliterator/simplewifi) via gRPC. There is an EXE bundled inside the artifact which can be extracted and run to start the gRPC server.

More information and documentation is on the way. However, this project is still unstable so don't hold your breath.
